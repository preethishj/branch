They identified the Metro bundler upgrade as the root cause and reverted the upgrade. Branch AI suggested adding `deferInitForPluginRuntime: true` in branch.json to address potential race conditions and requested more details and logs. The customer confirmed the issue affects all users and involves Branch not detecting or parsing non-Branch links correctly. No resolution yet; awaiting further diagnostics or agent assistance.","If you're using different versions, this may cause issues such as the +non_branch_link parameter not appearing after the Metro / React Native upgrade.","I checked the Expo compatibility matrix.
