Their goal is for users with the app installed to open the app and users without the app to be routed directly to their website, avoiding app store prompts. On Instagram, the flow shows a ""Get the App"" page before redirecting automatically to the website, which is expected due to Instagram's lack of Universal Linking support. On Facebook, however, the app does not open even when installed; instead, the link opens in Facebook's in-app browser with no prompt to open the app. Clearing cache helped partially but did not resolve the app opening issue on Facebook. The customer uses Facebook Ads Manager with a traffic objective and places the Branch link in the Website URL field, but no deep link field is available. Branch support explained that Meta's browser requires routing through a Branch web view to fire URI schemes to open the app, causing the intermediate page. They confirmed this flow is expected and that Facebook Ads Manager may not support simultaneous app and website routing in one campaign. Branch is investigating if redirect times can be shortened and requested confirmation on whether the redirect on the Branch page is automatic or requires user action. The customer confirmed Instagram redirects automatically, but Facebook does not. Branch is escalating internally and awaiting further updates.
