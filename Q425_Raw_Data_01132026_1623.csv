They receive INSTALL event postbacks for both OS, and FIRST_PURCHASE postbacks for Android, but not for iOS, despite FIRST_PURCHASE events showing on the Branch dashboard. Postback URLs and click URLs were reviewed; no issues found with click URL format. Branch confirmed postbacks are sent but many return 400/500 errors, often due to missing or incorrect session_id and campaign_id parameters. The customer’s server only accepts FIRST_PURCHASE events, rejecting others with 400 errors. Postback logs older than 7 days are unavailable. Recent iOS FIRST_PURCHASE events are recorded on Branch but not received by the customer, with DNS timeout errors indicating connection issues. The customer lacks access to Branch data exports due to missing permissions; Branch support clarified required permissions and confirmed the customer was not granted sensitive data access initially. After client permission updates, the customer gained export access and requested guidance on export columns to identify postback success and failure reasons. Next steps: Branch to assist with export configuration and further investigate DNS timeout and postback delivery failures for iOS FIRST_PURCHASE events.

Their goal is for users with the app installed to open the app and users without the app to be routed directly to their website, avoiding app store prompts. On Instagram, the flow shows a ""Get the App"" page before redirecting automatically to the website, which is expected due to Instagram's lack of Universal Linking support. On Facebook, however, the app does not open even when installed; instead, the link opens in Facebook's in-app browser with no prompt to open the app. Clearing cache helped partially but did not resolve the app opening issue on Facebook. The customer uses Facebook Ads Manager with a traffic objective and places the Branch link in the Website URL field, but no deep link field is available. Branch support explained that Meta's browser requires routing through a Branch web view to fire URI schemes to open the app, causing the intermediate page. They confirmed this flow is expected and that Facebook Ads Manager may not support simultaneous app and website routing in one campaign. Branch is investigating if redirect times can be shortened and requested confirmation on whether the redirect on the Branch page is automatic or requires user action. The customer confirmed Instagram redirects automatically, but Facebook does not. Branch is escalating internally and awaiting further updates. The customer seeks a solution to enable seamless app opening on Facebook ads without forcing app installs or showing intermediate pages.","Low Effort (No Improvement Needed)","https://api2.branch.io/v2/logs/e5cb2608-4078-4d08-9f03-616cd0d16b8e?app_id=469533981843411669","https://api2.branch.io/v2/logs/e5cb2608-4078-4d08-9f03-616cd0d16b8e?app_id=469533981843411669","TS Handled"," ","24.00000000000000000000"

They were particularly concerned about unexpectedly high organic event counts on Google despite low organic marketing efforts. Branch Support explained that attribution differences arise because Branch collects event data and sends it to Self-Attributing Network (SAN) partners like Google, which apply their own attribution logic. Branch then uses last-touch attribution to assign credit. Support provided detailed event attribution logs showing many events not claimed or attributed to Google due to no claim, last-touch to other partners, or attribution window expiration. This clarifies why Google reports higher numbers than Branch. The case remains open for further questions from the customer.","Low Effort (No Improvement Needed)","Branch Support explained that attribution differences arise because Branch collects event data and sends it to Self-Attributing Network (SAN) partners like Google, which apply their own attribution logic.
