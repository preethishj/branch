Branch Support clarified environment support, recommended adding all link domains to associated domains and info.plist, and explained Branch’s use of universal links and URI schemes. The customer resolved initial staging environment issues but reopened the ticket due to a problem where Branch links do not trigger on fresh iOS app installs via the App Store, though they work on Android and subsequent opens. Branch Support attributed this to iOS 17 privacy changes and suggested enabling NativeLink deepview and reviewing SDK integration. The customer shared implementation details; Branch Support identified a possible delay in the branch.subscribe call due to a conditional check and recommended following official React Native integration docs and sample code. The customer plans to refactor code and inquired about the impact of missing expo-tracking-transparency on the issue. The ticket remains open pending customer testing and updates.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","As mentioned in the documentation, you must add it explicitly to prevent an issue where Branch analytics fields, such as$~campaign$, may come through as unpopulated.

The pasteboard (NativeLink) method works, but Razvan wants DDL without requiring pasteboard access due to user privacy concerns. Branch support explained that without pasteboard, DDL is not guaranteed because the user opts out of NativeLink, and the initial install/open does not have link data. Razvan confirmed NativeLink was disabled in dashboard and SDK, but still no DDL data. Logs and code snippets were shared; Branch suspects getLatestReferringParams() may be called before SDK initialization completes. Branch requested logs, screen recordings, and testflight builds to investigate. Razvan clarified focus is solely on deferred deep linking (not standard deep linking). Branch also asked about network blockers (none used) and suggested clearing Safari cache in simulator. Razvan confirmed Safari 307 redirect to App Store URL causes ""address invalid"" error in simulator but is expected. Branch engineering wants to verify if getLatestReferringParams() is called properly and requested testflight with logging enabled. No resolution yet; next steps include verifying SDK initialization timing, reviewing logs for install/open calls, and running tests on Android. A call or screen share was offered to review implementation."," "," "," "," ","2025-10-03T17:47:21","8-24 hrs","7-30 days","Default Self Service","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

They receive INSTALL event postbacks for both OS, and FIRST_PURCHASE postbacks for Android, but not for iOS, despite FIRST_PURCHASE events showing on the Branch dashboard. Postback URLs and click URLs were reviewed; no issues found with click URL format. Branch confirmed postbacks are sent but many return 400/500 errors, often due to missing or incorrect session_id and campaign_id parameters. The customer’s server only accepts FIRST_PURCHASE events, rejecting others with 400 errors. Postback logs older than 7 days are unavailable. Recent iOS FIRST_PURCHASE events are recorded on Branch but not received by the customer, with DNS timeout errors indicating connection issues. The customer lacks access to Branch data exports due to missing permissions; Branch support clarified required permissions and confirmed the customer was not granted sensitive data access initially. After client permission updates, the customer gained export access and requested guidance on export columns to identify postback success and failure reasons. Next steps: Branch to assist with export configuration and further investigate DNS timeout and postback delivery failures for iOS FIRST_PURCHASE events. Customer provided device ID for test event tracing.","Documentation Gap","Older iOS SDK","Requested to update the iOS SDK to latest","Attribution issues with iOS ATT","2025-10-06T07:49:16","1-8 hrs",">30 days","Coupang (coupang.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

Branch support investigated and found no iOS attribution data flowing for Snapchat campaigns, likely due to lack of App Tracking Transparency (ATT) consent and missing App Store Connect API key for SKAdNetwork (SKAN) integration. Branch explained differences in attribution models causing discrepancies with Snapchat's reported installs. Despite multiple technical sessions, tests, and adding the API key, iOS attribution issues persisted. The customer noted installs were previously tracked well with Adjust without ATT. Due to unresolved attribution problems impacting marketing ROI, the customer requested to close the agreement, offering to settle for services rendered. Branch proposed a tri-party call with Snapchat to resolve, but the customer declined further calls. The case is closed with no further action.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-10-06T18:45:25","1-8 hrs",">30 days","Drahim (drahim.sa)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

The root cause includes missing Impression ID (iid) and GAID parameters in some postbacks, causing server rejections (400 errors) when device IDs are absent, especially for iOS users who decline ATT prompts. Branch confirmed their server rejects webhooks without device IDs and advised Next to remove this validation. Next requested unaggregated webhook logs with ""can_claim=1"" (attributed events) from Branch for the last 7 days due to data retention limits. Branch awaited admin approval to share data, which was granted. Branch provided logs for the last week containing successful events but not failed ones. Next clarified they need both successful and failed events with ""can_claim=1"" and ""a_dataseat"" webhook_partner_key to analyze and recover missing data. The current status is Branch awaiting confirmation to provide failed event logs. Next expects Branch to share these logs to help identify and resolve postback delivery issues. No further actions or deadlines were explicitly stated.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-10-09T13:31:21","0-1 hrs","7-30 days","Next Retail Limited UK (next.co.uk)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

They also raised concerns about Nonreward URLs incorrectly redirecting to iOS instead of Google Play for Android campaigns.

While Branch links open correctly and route users properly on cold and warm app starts outside Facebook, within Facebook’s in-app browser the app opens but does not deep link to the correct in-app content on cold start. The problem appears related to URI Scheme handling on cold start when launched from Facebook, whereas Universal Linking works fine outside Facebook. Branch support and Meta are involved; Branch engineering requested DSG’s SDK implementation details and test builds with logs to investigate potential race conditions or integration issues. DSG provided example links and screencasts. Meta confirmed the URI Scheme used in ads. Branch is escalating internally to identify if SDK initialization or Facebook’s handling of URI Schemes on cold start causes the failure. Next steps include DSG sharing code snippets and test builds with Branch, and Branch engineering reviewing the integration to resolve the cold start deep linking failure specifically within Facebook’s in-app browser environment.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-10-11T04:17:25","1-8 hrs",">30 days","Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods (dcsg.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

They want a dynamic solution to replace the environment portion of the redirect URL via a parameter (e.g., env=fdsc) to streamline testing across multiple environments. Branch Support clarified that Branch does not support dynamic macro replacement via query parameters but suggested using the $desktop_url parameter to dynamically encode the full redirect URL per environment. The customer requested a Branch representative to join a call on Friday 3-4 PM to discuss alternative solutions beyond the current recommendation. No resolution yet; next step is the scheduled call.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-10-15T21:29:26","1-8 hrs","7-30 days","Bell Canada (bell.ca)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

To meet this, the app uses BranchAttributionLevelNone, disabling install/open/reinstall data collection. Branch confirmed the SDK does not collect device IDs automatically; tracking requires user opt-in via ATT prompt and presence of AdSupport and AppTrackingTransparency frameworks. Without these, no IDFA is collected, so paid ad install attribution is unavailable unless SKAdNetwork (SKAN) and AdServices frameworks are integrated with BranchAttributionLevelReduced for privacy-preserving attribution. Organic/owned channel attribution remains possible without IDFA or ATT. Branch recommends removing AdSupport and AppTrackingTransparency frameworks to comply, using reduced attribution level plus SKAN and AdServices for privacy-compliant paid ad measurement. No attribution or analytics-only modes disable organic attribution. The team is verifying SDK integration readiness and clarifying event support.

Branch Support clarified that ""unpopulated"" installs are organic, unattributed installs lacking last-touch data, not linked to QR codes or paid campaigns. Belk requested detailed analysis and screenshots comparing Branch data to store reports, but internal reporting is solely from Branch, limiting discrepancy evidence. Multiple meeting invites were sent to Branch for urgent technical review; a call was scheduled to discuss the issue and analyze 10-15 days of install data. Branch noted overall install trends appear consistent, with a significant portion categorized as unpopulated installs. The case remains open pending technical investigation and collaborative review in scheduled calls.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-10-16T23:42:36","8-24 hrs","7-30 days","Belk (belk.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

Branch's dashboard shows stable INITIATE_PURCHASE event trends post-incident, but the customer remains concerned about the lower overall attributed events and efficiency on iOS.

Branch noted the clicks data is received directly from Facebook and cannot be independently verified. Meta support advised filing a ticket for escalation and investigation.

Branch requested sample ad URLs, campaign info, feed file snippets, app builds, and logs for debugging. The customer provided sample URI schemes and campaign details but no specific ad links, and shared screen recordings. Branch clarified that the URI schemes are handled by the app and redirects by Google/Meta, so the issue likely lies outside Branch's control. A call was requested for further troubleshooting.

They inquired about whether separate Branch Ad Links are needed for iOS and Android and raised concerns about iOS data discrepancies at the event pass level, also requesting guidance on verifying ATT implementation in Branch UI. Branch Support clarified that the OS selection in Ad Link is not mandatory, and iOS conversions are being sent properly to The TradeDesk with successful postbacks. The main issue was that the ad preview link used a different Branch partner parameter ($3p) linked to ""Meta"" instead of The TradeDesk, causing misattribution. Branch recommended using the correct tracking link to ensure proper attribution. The customer is crosschecking settings with their Publicis team and awaiting further instructions on ATT verification.

A meeting was held to review Branch event setup, validate social media connections, and discuss LinkedIn integration. Actions completed include LinkedIn custom link creation and enabling PAM for Facebook/X installs. The main open issues are investigating data mismatches with Google and Apple, and adding page-screen breakdowns in upcoming releases. Branch confirmed event data is sent but not claimed by Google/Apple, suggesting partner-side attribution issues. A Branch iOS SDK bug affecting Apple Search Ads was ruled out.

Branch noted the clicks data is received directly from Facebook and cannot be independently verified. Meta support advised filing a ticket for escalation and investigation. The customer seeks clarity on how Branch attributes installs to Facebook without last-click data and whether multiple installs per click are possible. Meta and Branch are coordinating internally and with the customer to investigate, but no definitive root cause or resolution has been identified yet.

Branch confirmed Skyfall is already a universal ad partner and created an agency account for access. Skyfall requested guidance on accessing the postback template and Branch’s integration settings, seeking documentation similar to other SDK providers. Due to communication challenges, Skyfall proposed online meetings to clarify integration details and expedite completion, citing lost sales opportunities. Branch provided dashboard navigation instructions and offered further support. Next steps include scheduling the meeting and finalizing integration setup.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-10-24T07:37:23","0-1 hrs",">30 days","Coupang (coupang.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

Branch Support found the account was configured for Auth0 SSO, conflicting with the customer's Microsoft SSO setup, causing login failures. After disabling Auth0 SSO, normal login was restored.

Their goal is for users with the app installed to open the app and users without the app to be routed directly to their website, avoiding app store prompts. On Instagram, the flow shows a ""Get the App"" page before redirecting automatically to the website, which is expected due to Instagram's lack of Universal Linking support. On Facebook, however, the app does not open even when installed; instead, the link opens in Facebook's in-app browser with no prompt to open the app. Clearing cache helped partially but did not resolve the app opening issue on Facebook. The customer uses Facebook Ads Manager with a traffic objective and places the Branch link in the Website URL field, but no deep link field is available. Branch support explained that Meta's browser requires routing through a Branch web view to fire URI schemes to open the app, causing the intermediate page. They confirmed this flow is expected and that Facebook Ads Manager may not support simultaneous app and website routing in one campaign. Branch is investigating if redirect times can be shortened and requested confirmation on whether the redirect on the Branch page is automatic or requires user action. The customer confirmed Instagram redirects automatically, but Facebook does not. Branch is escalating internally and awaiting further updates. The customer seeks a solution to enable seamless app opening on Facebook ads without forcing app installs or showing intermediate pages.","Low Effort (No Improvement Needed)","https://api2.branch.io/v2/logs/e5cb2608-4078-4d08-9f03-616cd0d16b8e?app_id=469533981843411669","https://api2.branch.io/v2/logs/e5cb2608-4078-4d08-9f03-616cd0d16b8e?app_id=469533981843411669","TS Handled","2025-10-28T01:40:23","0-1 hrs","7-30 days","American Red Cross (redcross.org)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

Branch support clarified that DV360 supports up to 10 custom events named in a specific format (custom, custom_1, etc.) and advised renaming events accordingly. Logs showed Branch forwarded events, but DV360 did not claim any, likely due to no active campaigns or attribution setup issues. The customer was advised to run test campaigns and check with Google support on event claiming. After campaigns went live, impressions for Branch events were still missing in DV360 Floodlight activities. Branch support reviewed logs confirming no claims by DV360 and recommended verifying campaign setup and attribution parameters. A call was scheduled to resolve the issue. The customer later confirmed the main issue was resolved but requested guidance on why campaign names remain unpopulated in Branch reports and how to access detailed DV360 campaign data.

Branch support confirmed that SDK versions between 3.4.2 and 3.12.1 included fixes to reduce duplicate events by introducing unique event identifiers, leading to more accurate but lower event counts. This aligns with the customer's Firebase data, indicating improved accuracy. Branch provided comparative data showing fewer duplicates in the newer SDK, especially for PURCHASE and VIEW_ITEM events. The customer requested confirmation on whether the drop is solely due to duplicate removal and asked for details on impacted events. Branch is investigating further and has shared analysis confirming the reduction in duplicates. The current status is that the drop is attributed to deduplication improvements, with ongoing verification of VIEW_ITEM duplicates. No further action is explicitly stated beyond continued monitoring and communication.","Low Effort (No Improvement Needed)","na","doc","IOS SDK update","2025-10-29T20:46:25","8-24 hrs","7-30 days","Empik (empik.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

The problem was consistent across devices and apps. Branch support confirmed the app opened via Universal Linking, but the presence of the al_applink_data parameter in the URL caused the failure; removing it allowed proper linking. Meta requested detailed info including device/app versions, campaign IDs, Charles Proxy logs, and troubleshooting steps. Marriott shared campaign IDs and screen recordings. Branch and Meta teams confirmed correct campaign setup but could not fully test as the campaign ended. Next steps include possibly running a test campaign to capture proxy logs and further collaboration between Branch, Meta, and Marriott to identify the root cause and resolve the deeplink failure.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-11-04T15:15:31","1-8 hrs","7-30 days","Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts (marriott.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

Branch support confirmed the Branch SDK might not be active on the site currently and requested confirmation. The customer clarified the issue relates to the CORS header on these custom domains, which are CNAMEs forwarding to Branch services. Branch asked if the customer wants the wildcard removed or restricted to specific domains and if this blocks release or is advisory. The customer confirmed the need to remove the wildcard as it impacts their security rating and release. Branch engineering and security teams investigated and explained the wildcard header appears only when no Origin header is sent, with no impact on live services. They are evaluating removing this wildcard behavior to improve security posture but are currently in a code freeze. The customer requested updates due to the issue affecting their rating. Branch acknowledged the urgency and promised to provide updates once available. Current status: Under internal review with no resolution yet; no explicit next steps beyond awaiting Branch engineering updates.","Low Effort (No Improvement Needed)","na","doc","access control origin","2025-11-04T20:45:35","8-24 hrs"," Unsolved","ActivoBank (activobank.pt)","Pending",">30 days","1.00000000000000000000"

Without these, no IDFA is collected, so paid ad install attribution is unavailable unless SKAdNetwork (SKAN) and AdServices frameworks are integrated with BranchAttributionLevelReduced for privacy-preserving attribution. Organic/owned channel attribution remains possible without IDFA or ATT. Branch recommends removing AdSupport and AppTrackingTransparency frameworks to comply, using reduced attribution level plus SKAN and AdServices for privacy-compliant paid ad measurement. No attribution or analytics-only modes disable organic attribution. The team is verifying SDK integration readiness and clarifying event support. No further actions are explicitly stated.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-11-08T03:27:29","0-1 hrs","1-7 days","Adobe (adobe.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

They are unable to track clicks from the feed properly. Branch support identified that the Branch click URL is correct but the product feed URLs are direct site links, which is expected. The key issue is that the CMPID parameter used for tracking is only appended in the product feed URLs, not in the Branch click URL, so Branch does not receive it for proper deeplink routing and tracking. S2S tracking is enabled correctly.

Branch advised that CMPID and other tracking parameters must be appended to the Branch click URL as link data parameters to enable proper deeplinking and tracking. Postback configuration for click events is missing and needs to be enabled by the app admin to forward click data to the ad network. The customer requested detailed step-by-step instructions on how to append CMPID and configure deeplinks for dynamic feeds.

Branch provided example URLs showing how to append CMPID to the click URL and recommended a triparty discussion with the app admin to finalize parameter handling and deeplink routing. The customer seeks a final working deeplink example or configuration to ensure tracking works end-to-end. No explicit errors were reported, but tracking data is incomplete due to missing parameter passing and postback setup.

Next steps: Customer to coordinate with app admin to enable click postbacks and confirm CMPID usage; Branch to provide detailed configuration guidance and example deeplink URLs with CMPID appended; potential call to finalize integration. The main problem is incomplete parameter passing in Branch links causing tracking failures for dynamic product feed campaigns.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","None","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-11-14T07:25:14","0-1 hrs",">30 days","Flipkart (flipkart.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

Branch support identified that the live link's data includes $ios_url and $android_url parameters pointing to a website, causing users without the app installed to be redirected there instead of the app store. They advised removing these parameters from the link data and setting a default URL in the Branch dashboard to ensure proper fallback behavior. The customer requested clarification on where to find and modify $ios_url and $android_url values in the dashboard.

The Branch support agent requested the Branch App ID, example links, Info.plist, Associated Domains config, SDK logs, and a TestFlight build to investigate. Upon review, the agent identified configuration gaps: the Associated Domains in Xcode mismatched the Branch dashboard domains and missed the alternate domain; Info.plist lacked required Branch SDK keys and URL types. Additionally, the customer’s domain nameservers were incompatible with Branch’s requirements, needing update to Branch’s AWS nameservers for proper routing. The agent provided detailed instructions and documentation links for correcting these issues. No resolution yet; next steps involve the customer updating configurations and domain settings as advised.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-11-19T22:40:41",">24 hrs","7-30 days","1481703570536419725 - Self-serve (wildalaskancompany.com)","Closed"," Solved","1.00000000000000000000"

The customer questions why events show under an ""other"" channel and why events do not appear in Google despite mapping. They also ask about handling the OS field for WebApp events, as Branch expects only ""ios"" or ""Android."" Branch recommends correcting event mapping, including device IDs and platform details, and clarifies the attribution process involving self-attributing networks.

They have confirmed the correct app bundle ID and Branch key are used, and associated domains are configured in Xcode. However, Branch support identified mismatches in URI schemes and associated domains between the app and Branch dashboard, and missing or incomplete URL types entries in Info.plist. The customer shared AppDelegate.swift, Info.plist screenshots, and TestFlight builds for review. Despite following documentation and enabling logging, the issue persists. Branch support requested verbose logs and confirmed missing URL types in Info.plist as a likely root cause. The customer is open to a call to resolve urgently due to business impact. Next steps include the customer verifying and adding the required URL types entry in Info.plist, and Branch support continuing to analyze logs and test the TestFlight build once approved. The ticket remains open awaiting these actions.","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation"," ","Not Applicable - Ticket Solved by Automation","2025-11-24T14:20:28","0-1 hrs"," Unsolved","ARNE (arneclo.com)","Open",">30 days","1.00000000000000000000"

The customer prefers using SAN deferred deep linking without Instant Experience, as Instant Experience adds unwanted user steps. Despite following documentation and multiple troubleshooting steps, the issue remains unresolved, causing app sprint delays and customer frustration over prolonged email exchanges.

Additionally, the ""Has app installed"" flag may be unreliable on test devices due to repeated app installs/uninstalls, causing banners to show incorrectly. The customer was guided to test on a clean device or wait for backend updates. The agent cannot test from Australia due to access restrictions and requested support team assistance to debug the issue within India.

Key issues include a spike in Google-reported installs after re-enabling SAN Deferred Deep Linking (DDL), which was not reflected in Branch's data, and differences in new vs. reinstall attribution between Branch's Unified and Activity views. Google confirmed reported installs include modeled conversions, and Branch confirmed reinstall postbacks were disabled after Nov 21. The hypothesis is that DDL triggers Google to attribute installs unilaterally, causing inflated Google numbers and organic reinstalls in Branch. Branch is requested to verify organic reinstall spikes to validate this.

The link uses the domain kfc.com.au, which is configured as an Android App Link in the app manifest, causing Android to open the app by design. Branch support confirmed this behavior is due to the Android manifest and suggested either temporarily disabling the app link for testing or implementing code to force webview opening using the $web_only parameter. Alternatives include changing the fallback URL to a different domain or using Branch’s Activation product to open web-only links in an in-app webview. The customer cannot change the manifest as the app link is required for other campaigns. Branch also proposed a workaround involving rendering the landing page inside an iframe via a deepview fallback URL, but this requires the website’s Content Security Policy to whitelist branch.io for framing. The customer has limited development resources and seeks solutions that do not require app code or manifest changes. Previous campaigns with identical setups worked on Android as recently as three months ago, indicating no recent configuration changes. Branch support is awaiting confirmation on which solution the customer will pursue and offered to review app code if needed.

The issue was linked to a duplicate Performance Basics plan provisioned on their account, causing configuration problems and potential double billing. Branch's billing and L3 engineering teams are investigating, with the engineering team expected to provide an update within a day. While the MoEngage connector issue was resolved and integration is underway, the customer still cannot add new ad partners or configure postback events. The customer emphasized the urgency due to significant business impact and requested clear ownership, root cause, and timelines. Branch acknowledged the severity, confirmed escalation, and committed to providing a concrete update soon.

Branch support clarified that `branch_force_new_session` is not added to the Branch link URL but must be explicitly added as an Intent extra in app code (e.g., `intent.putExtra(""branch_force_new_session"", true)`) to force a new session, typically in warm start scenarios.

However, they observe varied outcomes on the same device and app version: sometimes redirecting to the App Store despite the app being installed, sometimes opening the app but not landing on the deep-linked screen, and sometimes working correctly. Direct URI scheme deep linking works reliably, isolating the issue to universal link handling. They request assistance diagnosing why universal link routing inconsistently drops deep link payloads or incorrectly redirects to the App Store.
